Lego-Pixel-Color
================

this is a custom program that takes an image and breaks it up into one by one lego blocks or just pixels. I made this 
program when I was trying to make lego pixel art. no more hit and miss with this program. I just pick the image that I want
to make into pixel art are and the program does it. there are variables that control how many pixels the program creates.

enjoy! :)
